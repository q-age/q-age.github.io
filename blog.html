            <h2>Section 1 - AGI</h2>
            <p>
                One of our first projects is to create AGI using classical computing algorithms. This will form the foundation of the intelligent system that will help us enable progress our quantum algorithms while we formalise our hardware strategy. AGI in software will still be very capable of generating predictions in capability, so we will be able to use this from the point of creation.

            <h2>Section 2 - Quantum Simulator</h2>
            <p>
                In parallel to AGI, we are building a quantum simulator with which we can develop a programming language that will enable us, and others to build high level simulation programs that will be able to simulate real world physics and therefore provide very accurate results.

            <h2>Section 3 - Quantum Computing Hardware</h2>
            <p>
                To use our quantum simulations we will need a hardware strategy. If we are able to get the funding, then we would want to build our own hardware. This will enable us to provide others with highly sensitive architecture but with modifications that would enable this to be used safely.
